Hello to all of you. 

First of all, I wanted to present the RageUI project. 

What is RageUI? 

RageUI, and a project specially created to replace the NativeUILua-Reloaded library. 
This library allows to create menus similar to the one of big Theft Auto online, however this library is still young and has many problems. 

The implementation of this open source project was done faster than expected in order to be able to count on the community to improve it and solve the concerns currently present on it. [See the tab]. 

This project would never have been possible without the trust [Frazzle] placed in me, so I wanted to thank him for trusting me to carry out this project. 

Thank you very much to all the contributors who allowed me to move forward on this project.
